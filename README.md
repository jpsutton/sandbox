=======

This git repo holds little bits of code that I (Jared Sutton, jpsutton@gmail.com) have written and want to make public.  They're probably little things that I've written to 
solve a particular problem.  If you stumble on anything you find useful, then great.  If you want to recommend changes, feel free to contact me or send me a pull request.

Licensing
==========
Unless otherwise noted, all the code in this repository is licensed under the GNU General Public License, Version 2 (GPLv2) ONLY.  If you find yourself in the extraordinarily 
unusual situation of needing to use my code under a more permissive license, send me an email, and we'll see if we can work something out.  I'm a pretty nice guy, so don't be 
afraid to speak up (so long as you're polite).
